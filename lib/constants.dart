const general = '''The correct marking and labelling of packages containing dangerous goods is an important element in the safe transport process.  Marks and labels fulfil the following general purposes:
 •	they indicate the contents of the package;
 •	they indicate that the packaging meets approved standards;
 •	they provide safe handling and stowage information;
 •	they indicate the nature of hazard(s).

The shipper is responsible for the correct marking and labelling of packages presented for transport.  The freight forwarder and operators‘s or ground service provider‘s dangerous goods acceptance staff are required to perform a check to verify that all packages are correctly marked and labelled in accordance with the requirements of the DGR before accepting the consignment for carriage by air.''';

const marking = '''For each package and overpack containing DG that requires marking, the shipper must:
1.	check that the required marks are applied in the correct locations on the package and that the marks meet the quality and specification requirements of the Regulations;
2.	ensure that where UN specification packaging is required, that the packaging meets the requirements set out in the applicable packing instruction and the specification marks conform:
3.	remove or obliterate any irrelevant marks;
4.	ensure that all of the required marks have been applied when the package is presented to the operator.
There are two types of marks:
•	marks which identify the use of a particular packaging for a particular shipment; and
•	marks which identify the design or specification of a packaging, i.e. UN specification packagings marks or marks to indicate limited quantity packagings.
As a minimum each package or overpack containing DG must be clearly marked  to show:
•	the proper shipping name(s);
•	the applicable UN or ID Numbers(s); and
•	the full name and address of the shipper and the consignee.
