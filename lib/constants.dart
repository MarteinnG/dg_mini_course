 •	they indicate that the packaging meets approved standards;
 •	they provide safe handling and stowage information;
 •	they indicate the nature of hazard(s).

The freight forwarder and operators‘s or ground service provider‘s dangerous goods acceptance staff are required to perform a check to verify that all packages are correctly marked and labelled in accordance with the requirements of the DGR before accepting the consignment for carriage by air.''';
